**fakeProfile** is a plugin for **Vencord** that supports all features related to nitro profile editing `without` the need to use individual plugins to create a complete profile with features such as:

> - ✅ Supports custom static and animated banner without need nitro[^1] [^2].
> - ✅ Supports custom static and animated avatar without need nitro[^1] [^2].
> - ✅ Supports choosing Discord's available badges and you can custom your own badges[^1] [^3].
> - ✅ Supports choosing Discord's available effect profiles without need nitro[^1] [^2].
> - ✅ Supports changing theme profile color without needing nitro[^1] [^3].
> - ✅ Supports selecting and custom decorations without needing nitro[^1] [^2].
> - ✅ Support show **fakeProfile** badges in chat[^1] [^3].
> - ✅ Supports approval of avatars, banners and badges using **AI** extremely quickly and conveniently. You won't have to wait too long for your request to be sent.
> - ✅ We pride ourselves on our plugin being the **`fastest`** and **`fully automatic`** refresh every **2 minutes** from the latest request being approved without having to reload Discord or restart the client and of course you can also refresh the plugin manually if you don't want to wait[^1] [^3].

[^1]: This feature is only available to users of this plugin.
[^2]: The feature only works when other plugins related to this feature are disabled because other plugins can override that plugin's features on this plugin.
[^3]: This feature may work with some other plugins.

1. Can everyone in Discord see my profile?
 - No, everyone in Discord will not see about your Profile change but in case if they also use the fakeProfile plugin then they will see your change.

2. If I leave the Discord server, will everything on my profile be lost?
 - No, because your requests will be saved in the plugin's database, so if you leave the server, everything will not be affected. *(unless you turn off the fakeProfile plugin, everything will return to the way it was when you didn't use this plugin)*

3. So what happens if I disable fakeProfile plugin?
 - As I answered in the 2nd QnA, everything will return to the way it was before you used this plugin. Of course, you can still turn it back on if you want to use it, but if you don't want to use it anymore, you have the right to turn this plugin off.
